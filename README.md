Phantom is a high performance Minecraft core that allows servers (and networks) to create a manageable, stable and lag-free
gaming experience for their players. It also provides seamlessly integrated administrative tools so that it is easier to 
manage your server as it grows. It contains all features you will ever need in a core, these include features for both Spigot
and BungeeCord. A detailed list of features can be found under the [Features](#features) section.
